# Exploratory Data Analysis of Global Cancer Data and Inferential Analysis  

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and inferential statistical study of a global cancer dataset. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in cancer incidence and mortality rates across different countries, regions, and cancer types.  

## Objectives  
- Explore and visualize global cancer data.  
- Identify patterns in incidence and mortality.  
- Apply inferential statistics to test hypotheses and draw insights.  
- Provide data-driven observations that can support awareness, research, and policy.  

## Dataset  
- Includes statistics such as:  
  - Cancer incidence and mortality rates  
  - Country and region breakdowns  
  - Cancer type classifications  
- **Source:** *Kaggle*  

## Methodology  
1. **EDA** – descriptive statistics, distributions, correlations, and visualizations.  
2. **Inferential Analysis** – hypothesis testing, regression, and confidence intervals.
## Tools & Libraries  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scipy, Statsmodels
